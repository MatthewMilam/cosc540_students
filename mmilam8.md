I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. I also have a minor in Mathematics. Data Structures and Algorithms is my favorite field of Computer Science, but I also have some experience in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity.
An area I am most passionate about is muscle mechanics and sports technology, but this often invovles a lot of hardware and firmware development so I'm not sure how applicable this could be for this course.
